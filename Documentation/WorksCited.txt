Most of the code for this project was custom, but we did use some sources for inspiration.

Thanks to Mark Guzdial from Georgia Tech for his free chapter "Designing Object Systems", given
at this link: http://sdmeta.gforge.inria.fr/FreeBooks/GuzdialBookDrafts/DesignObjects-ch4.pdf

While we didn't end up using his design, it provided valuable inspiration on how to get started.

We also used the following StackOverflow thread: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3342651/how-can-i-delay-a-java-program-for-a-few-seconds

which provided the code for delaying our program so the clock would count seconds appropriately.

Naturally, the JDK proved very useful for javadoc comments and document generation, as well as
information on using Threads.
